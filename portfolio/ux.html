        <h4>Project Summary</h4>
        <p>Holmes is a company that produces home-related products. My role was to make the
          positioning instructions for one of Holmes’ products accessible digitally, maintaining Holmes
          brand identity and preserving the original copy provided on paper-based instructions for the
          same product. I conducted this project on my own.</p>

        <h4>Research & Design Process</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Firstly I analyzed the information available on the paper-based instructions, selecting
          the content that would be most relevant to creating instructions specifically aimed at
          positioning the product. Afterwards, I focused on the colors and fonts that would match Holmes
          well-established brand identity. I created a stylesheet including these essential
          elements.</li>
          <li class="image">
            <figure>
              <img class="mockup" src="../good-website-images/stylesheet.png" alt="stylesheet for the
              instructions website"/>
              <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>Websites providing instructions are varied in essence, so I conducted
          research on two relevant competitors in the home products field. In particular, Ikea’s
          instructions served as a basis for me to understand the importance of having minimal,
          non-ambiguous and easy-to-understand icons in my final version of the instructions.</li>
          <li class="image">
            <figure>
              <img class="image" src="../good-website-images/ikea-instructions.png" alt="a screenshot
              of a file from Ikea's instructions"/>
              <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>Following best accessibility practices I decided to build the website in a way that even
          without reading a single word one could benefit from the instructions. I chose minimal icons
          that disambiguate the tasks users are required to perform to position the product effectively
          and safely. The icons were picked from free-stock png websites. Some of the icons were also
          subsequently modified by me using Google Drawings.</li>
          <article class="image-gallery">
            <li class="image">
              <figure>
                <img class="mockup icon" src="../good-website-images/child-icon.png" alt="an icon
                representing a child"/>
                <figcaption></figcaption>
              </figure>
            </li>
            <li class="image">
              <figure>
                <img class="mockup icon" src="../good-website-images/electrical-outlet-icon.jpg"
                alt="an icon representing an electrical outlet"/>

            </li>
          </article>
          <li>The website is fully translatable.
          One pain point of the paper-based version of Holmes instructions is exactly that of not being
          universally understandable, as only a finite number of languages can be provided. A
          digitization of the instructions allows for increased reach and accessibility.</li>
          <li class="image">

              <img class="image" src="../good-website-images/paper-based-instructions.jpeg" alt="a
              picture of the paper based-instructions for the humidifier, provided by Holmes"/>
              <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>I had two people testing out my website before reaching the final stage of the product.
          I used GitHub for version control and worked on several branches to keep working while my
          website was being tested by my users through GitHub Pages. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Learnings</h4>
        <p>The most challenging part of the project was building the website in a way that reading was not
        essential to the user experience. In the process of following instructions users are in all
        sorts of mental states and physical conditions. Making the website as straightforward as
        possible was a necessity, but providing additional text for those users who want to spend more
        time and increase the accuracy of the positioning task was also essential to the project.</p>
