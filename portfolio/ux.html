        <h4>Project Summary</h4>
        <p>Holmes is a company that produces home-related products. My aim was to make the
          positioning instructions for one of Holmes’ products accessible digitally, maintaining Holmes
          brand identity and preserving the original copy provided on paper-based instructions for the
          same product. I conducted this project on my own.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Research & Design Process</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Firstly I looked into Holmes' brand identity. In styling the website
            <h5>I respected the typographic and graphic choices that make the Holmes brand
            distinguishable.</h5> The website I developed aims to make the positioning instructions
            for one of Holmes' products more accessible. The website can be accessed by users with
            different needs and impairments. It doesn’t require reading, and the positioning process
            is guided by icons or simple pictures.</li>
          <li>My next step was to review the information available on the paper-based instructions,
          selecting the content that would be most relevant to creating instructions specifically
          aimed at positioning the product. Afterwards, I focused on the colors and fonts that would
          match Holmes well-established brand identity. I created a stylesheet including these
          essential elements.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Websites providing instructions are varied in essence, so I conducted
          research on two relevant competitors in the home products field. In particular, <h5>Ikea’s
          instructions</h5> served as a basis for me to understand the importance of having minimal,
          non-ambiguous and easy-to-understand icons in my final version of the instructions.</li>
          <li class="image">
            <figure>
              <img class="image" src="../good-website-images/ikea-instructions.png" alt="a screenshot
              of a file from Ikea's instructions"/>
              <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>However, I also looked into <h5><a href="https://blog.thebroadcat.com/2016/08/why-are-ikea-instructions-so-hard">
            complaints about Ikea's instructions</a>,</h5> which proved that staying minimal and entirely visual,
            while necessary to accomodate the needs of a diverse audience, is probably not the best
            possible way to approach a website entirely dedicated to instructions.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Personas</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>I developed two user personas on which my work was based. The two profiles provide an
            overview of two general categories that I identified as potential users of the intructions.
            The two personas below have their differences, especially with their time availability
            in an inverse relationship with the possibility of them misplacing the item.</li>

            </figure>
          </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Iconography</h4>
          <li>Following best accessibility practices I decided to build the website in a way that
          even without reading a single word one could benefit from the instructions, while making
          written  descriptions of each step available with one click. I chose minimal icons that
          disambiguate the tasks users are required to perform to position the product effectively
          and safely. The icons were picked from free-stock png websites. Some of the icons were
          also subsequently modified by me using Google Drawings.</li>

      </section>
      <section>
          <h4>Development</h4>
          <li>The website is fully translatable.
          <h5>One pain point of the paper-based version of Holmes instructions is exactly that of not being
          universally understandable,</h5> as only a finite number of languages can be provided. A
          digitization of the instructions allows for increased reach and accessibility.</li>
          <li class="image">
            <figure>
              <img class="image" src="../good-website-images/paper-based-instructions.jpeg" alt="a
              picture of the paper based-instructions for the humidifier, provided by Holmes"/>
              <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>I had two people testing out my website before reaching the final stage of the product.
          I used <h5>GitHub</h5> for version control and worked on several branches to keep working while my
          website was being tested by my users through GitHub Pages. </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Learnings</h4>
        <p>The most challenging part of the project was building the website in a way that reading was not
        essential to the user experience. In the process of following instructions users are in all
        sorts of mental states and physical conditions. Making the website as straightforward as
        possible was a necessity, but providing additional text for those users who want to spend more
        time and increase the accuracy of the positioning task was also essential to the project.</p>
