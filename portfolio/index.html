            <h4 class="odd-text">Open-heart Surgery</h4>
              <p>Words always seem to arrange themselves in the wrong way when it comes to speaking
              the truth about love. Recollecting memories of the very first time I fell for someone
              hurts still. I don’t believe in the death of such feelings. </p>

              <p>I remember meeting him on a Saturday in December. It was snowing lightly, which
              rarely  occurs where I live —but I would discover later on that that was not the case
              for his hometown. I was chatting with my friends about some party we never made it to,
              when his voice intruded on my mind’s slumber like a cold water jet in the middle of a
              hot shower. He sent me a voice message: “I like Chopin, and you’ve done this piece
              justice,” referring to a video I had posted on social media earlier that morning of me
              playing the piano. His profile was not as appealing. All I could glean was that he
              played the guitar, decently.</p>

              <p>Somehow, a never ending discussion aroused from that innocent comment. We talked
              about whatever we  could have possibly imagined, and by the time I woke up from that
              daydream several hours had passed.  I was tired, my friends were waiting for me to say
              something about that party. No, I wasn’t going to let that be another Saturday
              night.</p>

              <p>I hesitated. I felt like I could have burned the roots of what was going to grow
              into a beautiful love story with one single question. I waited a few minutes, fighting
              against my urge to talk to him in person and to look at each other in the eyes, until
              I couldn’t resist speaking my mind: “So what are we doing tonight? Pick me up at 9?”.
              He actually showed up.</p>

              <p>He was tall and muscular. His huskiness made me look quite petite and short, albeit I
            was wearing heels. His hair was so blonde, and I had just dyed mine black for the fifth
            time a few days back. Apart from the intimidating appearance, I could spot something
            unfamiliar in his look from the very first sight, and he didn’t make me wait too long to
            confirm my suspicion: he was half British.</p>

            <p>The date was amazing...but I still wonder if we might have just been blinded by the
            lights: in fact Christmas was just two weeks away. Maybe it was because of the
            illuminations, the trees, the ornaments, the thin ice layer on the ground and the crisp
            cold air of a winter night: would he have kissed me if I wasn’t shivering so hard that
            he had to hold me for a while? Because of that, he took me to a fancy bar in the city
            center, yet I was so cold that I chose to have a hot chocolate in the middle of a
            dancing crowd holding mojitos and beers. I surely stood out.</p>

            <p>He was so intelligent that I wanted to remain silent and listen to his thoughts on
            politics, religion and ethics, even though it was well-past midnight and I felt
            exhausted. By that time, we had walked for miles. My tendency to overshare and my
            talkativeness were overshadowed by his intellect. The passion and strength in his voice
            were palpable every time I brought up any topic dear to him, and that’s when I knew I
            was seriously going to fall for that man.</p>

            <p>Time passed by, and soon after my family figured out that I was in love. It wasn’t
            hard to tell: I am quiet, I like writing poetry and listening to loud indie music. The
            perpetual laughter they heard coming from my bedroom could only mean one thing. After
            meeting him on Christmas Eve my mother observed: “you’ve never been this happy your
            whole life, but you don’t need a man to be.” I wish I had taken her words seriously back
            then.</p>

            <p>It has been a while, but I do not feel that enough water has passed under the bridge
            just yet. When we separated, for some time I stood still. I sat on my bed in the dark,
            waiting for him to call, to knock at my door and tell me he was sorry for hurting my
            feelings. I expected him to show up with a bouquet of those flowers he grew in his
            garden, perhaps the ones I used to look at as it was covered with snow, every Sunday
            night when we had dinner on his sofa by the fire place. How naive was I?</p>

            <p>Intimacy is not something easily shared, and I believe there is nothing more intimate
            than being your true self with no shame or secrets to keep. Probably that was the most
            precious gift we shared. I like to think of myself as a deeply loving person, one major
            heartbreak will not keep me from opening my heart to someone else in the future. But I
            also realize it takes a specific kind of surgery to suture the wounds of the heart, and
            I’m waiting for a skilled surgeon to come. </p>

            <h4>Covid-19 upends job search for Class of 2021</h4>
            <p>The oldest of Gen-Z were to enter the gates of the best job market in 50 years.</p>

            <p>The Class of 2020 was made up of the disillusioned, lazy and entitled kids. Still
            they worked hard. They built visions and projects to change the World, only to be
            remembered as the Class of COVID-19. Now it’s time for the Class of 2021. Will their
            fate match their predecessors’ or will the job market take it easy on them?</p>

            <h5>The foundations</h5>

            <p>Graduating in the country with the best economy in the World. This was the luck of
            students all over the United States graduating in 2020.</p>

            <p>This was the luck of Keara Rigg, a 22-year-old girl who graduated from Illinois
            Institute of Technology in May 2020. Keara got a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. She
            planned to take a MCTA test and shadow a doctor at a local hospital for the summer
            following her graduation.</p>

            <p>This was the luck of Ahmer Rizwan, a 23-year-old Mechanical Engineering major at
            Illinois Institute of Technology. He graduated in May 2020. "I wanted to get a job and
            not go to grad school straight away,” says Ahmer “I had an internship in spring, from
            January to May 2020. The company was going to hire me.” The future looked bright for
            these students with a high quality education and experience in their fields of choice.
            But then a pandemic happened.</p>

            <h5>Crushed expectations</h5>

            <p>When the pandemic hit the country, the unemployment rate rose higher in three
            COVID-19 months than it did in two years of Great Recession. It reached an all-time high
            of 14.7 percent in April 2020, affecting young people the most. These two points seem to
            draw the two recessions close.</p>

            <p>However “The two recessions are very different.” stated in an email Giorgio
            Primiceri, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University in Chicago “The Great
            Recession was large, but overall relatively ‘conventional’...Covid, instead, caused a
            much more abrupt halt in economic activity. This recession has been much more
            violent...although the recovery has also been faster, at least so far.”</p>

            <p>Young people were among the most affected by the Covid recession, but the
            unemployment rates were lower among those with higher levels of education. Young
            students with a Bachelor’s degree are in fact the only group without a double digits
            percentage of unemployed, standing at 7.2 percent.</p>

            <p>“My boss told me they had 652 applications for the position,” said Ahmer Rizwan, a
            Mechanical Engineering major at IIT “but in the end I got it because I had a ton of
            experience related to the role.”</p>

            <h5>Getting in shape or sinking in?</h5>

            <p>The Class of 2021 saw it coming. They had more time to prepare.</p>

            <p> Yet the task does not look easier for them. More than 1.3 million students graduated
            from 2 or 4 year colleges in 2020, and the projections for 2021 are that this number
            will increase by almost 20 percent.</p>

            <p>“My plans were to get a job,” said Jack Pio, a Computer Engineering student at IIT
            who will graduate in May. “Last summer I did have an internship, but it was cancelled.
            Now I don’t have a job offer coming out of the summer.”</p>

            <p>However, sinking in is not an option.</p>

            <p>Students like Jack are still looking for a job that pays them justice. They are not
            going to graduate school only to take shelter from the present time.</p>

            <p>Students like Austin Worley, a senior Aerospace Engineering major at IIT, managed to
            get internships over the summer. They are focusing on their exams right now, looking
            forward to graduating in May.</p>

            <p>Getting in shape for the current job market requires time, hard-work and passion, but
            the Class of 2021 got them all.</p>

            <h5>A new era</h5>

            <p>This recession has hit students in different ways.</p>

            <p>“The service-producing sectors are suffering much more than good-producing sectors,”
            says Professor Giorgio Primiceri. “Consumption of goods has declined sharply in the
            first few months, but has recovered equally fast. Consumption of services, instead, is
            still 10% lower relative to February.”</p>

            <p>“The Tech industry has been growing because companies are shifting to the virtual
            more than ever. Medicine and psychology are also important right now,” Tiara De Guzman,
            a counselor at Illinois Institute of Technology’s Career Center, said via email
            “However, creative industries (architecture, design) and non-profit organizations have
            been shutting down.”</p>

            <p>Despite the strength of the Class of 2021, students are aware that the market is
            thornier than ever and they are getting advice from experts.</p>

            <p>“The biggest advice I have for this particular job search is to be adaptable,” said
            De Guzman “Many companies are doing virtual positions for a while and then expecting
            employees to relocate. Some have hiring freezes so it will take them longer to process
            applications. Be open and flexible.”</p>

            <p>The Covid recession could be start of a new era. An uncertain, scary and competitive
            era. Hopefully the oldest of Gen-Z are as stubborn as this society wants us to
            believe.</p>

          <section class="newspaper-article">
            <h4>Hindsight, the only weapon America has against COVID-19</h4>
            <p>History teaches us that the Western Roman Empire fell. But did it? The act of falling
            tends to have an immediacy of effect that flows from a rapid unfolding of the action: to
            fall. </p>
            <p>I want to suggest that the falling of the Roman Empire did not happen in the snap
            of a finger, but was more of a slow grazing process. In many ways, the Romans themselves
            were responsible for their own demise, and it seems that we are doing the same to our
            present World. </p>
            <p>America has millennia of history behind her. This country can still clean the mess it
            has made by labeling Asian communities as the enemy during this pandemic.  “America is
            what Rome once was to hustling Jews, Greeks and Numidians.” says Victor Davis Hanson,
            author of the hybrid-genre book Mexifornia “The freedom and material dynamism of the
            West are drawing millions to its shores.”  But if America doesn’t act fast people will
            no longer be so attracted to its land, and the country’s leaders’ reluctance to look
            back and learn from others might constitute the beginning of America’s end. </p>
            <h5>Historia Magistra Vitae</h5>
            <p>In his “De Oratore” Cicero was the first of many to refer to History as an essential
            teaching about life with the literal expression Historia magistra vitae.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the distance in time and space between a 2020 World citizen and
            Cicero, his reflection couldn’t be more relatable to the present situation. </p>
            <p>The Western Roman Empire slowly declined from 363 A.D. until 476 A.D.  It all began
            with the first invasion of the Huns, a nomadic people from the central Asian steppes.
            This event sparked a multi-generational migration phenomenon of Germanic tribes into
            Roman territory. </p>
            <p>The Romans and the Germans began mixing up very fast, to the
            extent that the Germans did not consider themselves foreign conquerors, but people who
            deserved stakeholder status in the empire.</p>
            <p>Still a great majority of the Romans
            did not realize this fusion had happened. “Lots of changes were taking place
            simultaneously in the 4th and 5th centuries, and the migration of Germanic peoples was
            only one of them.” said John Bauschatz, Professor of History and Classics at The
            University Of Arizona “It's also worth pointing out that the largest sections of the
            western empire that survived after AD 476 were run by pseudo-’Germanic’ peoples. So it's
            possible to argue...that the Germanic peoples successfully carried the legacy of Rome
            onward for several centuries after the fall.” </p>
            <p>of Rome onward for several
            centuries after the fall.”  The fusion was not enough to make Roman people understand
            they could not extirpate the Germans from their social structure, but instead that the
            new tribes could be a helping hand. Ignoring this caused the Western Roman Empire, the
            cradle of modern civilization, to fall.  What could we learn from this historical nuance
            about our present time?</p>
            <p>In a World as globalized as ours can we let ourselves believe that sidelining any
            group of individuals along with their history, their beliefs and their teachings can
            be of any good?</p>
            <h5>COVID-19: How A Disease Generated Waves Of Hate</h5>
            <p>COVID-19 is spreading hate
            and fear throughout our World.</p>
            <p>For many the fear of the virus has transformed
            into fear of the Other –which in this case happens to be any person of Asians descent.
            This phenomenon, is referred to as Xenophobia.  The word Xenophobia speaks for itself.
            Its etymology comes from the ancient Greek words ξένος, meaning “foreigner” and
            -φοβία, which means "fear". From this mere linguistic analysis one can easily date the
            start of this phenomenon to Classical Antiquity, even if its most concrete developments
            occurred far later in time. </p>
            <p>Millennia have passed, but the public opinion today looks like it could use a History
            refreshing. In Classical Antiquity, epidemics more often brought societies together
            rather than divided them. Much less civilized peoples, without any of our
            hyper-communication technologies. Yet we are struggling to do the same. </p>
            <p>Pandemics reshuffle power, deconstruct social structures, modify human
            behavior. Fearing them is a natural human impulse, but what we are doing today is an
            additional step: we are projecting this fear on other peoples. </p>
            <h5>Virus Narratives</h5>
            <p>Many countries are ousting Asian people, but we are not in the position to allow our
            leaders to make such decisions. </p>
            <p>“This virus China unleashed on the World” </p>
            <p>“I beat this crazy horrible Chinese virus” </p>
            <p>“It’s China’s fault” </p>
            <p>President Donald Trump has not hesitated to make sure his side of the story was
            heard. He arbitrarily chose to refer to Covid-19 as “Chinese virus” anytime he needed to
            mention it. This same narrative has been embraced by many other World leaders, to the
            extent that Wang Jisi, a scholar at Peking University, said “The virus fallout has
            pushed Sino-US relations to their worst level since formal ties were established in the
            1970s.” </p>
            <p>I had the chance to discuss the same matter with Lincoln Mitchell,
            Professor of Political Science at Columbia University N.Y. who told me “On one end we’re
            in competition...on the other end we have deep economic relationships with China. We
            need China and China needs us. It’s a too-big-to-fail bilateral relationship.” </p>
            <p>Furthermore, looking at the current status of international relations between America
            and China, Professor Mitchell was particularly clear on one point, “We have to have a
            relationship with China. A smart president has to figure out that we can’t get along
            with China on everything, but we need to have a balance. We need relationships more than
            ever right now.” </p>
            <p>Despite all of this, the amount of hate that has been spread
            cannot be undone. But is it really China’s fault? </p>
            <p>According to an article
            published on the Journal of Siberian Federal University in 2019, anthropogenic pressure
            and unhealthy lifestyles are the main factors involved in the birth and spread of
            pandemic diseases.</p>
            <h5>W.H.O. Did What?</h5>
            <p>The World Health Organization is an institution that aims at providing mediation
            among nations to ensure the best health environment possible.</p>
            <p>Since the pandemic spread in 2019, never has W.H.O. referred to coronavirus with any
            term related to China or the Chinese population. That is, of course, not just by
            chance.</p>
            <p>In 2015, after understanding how in the past viral diseases were frequently
            associated with the regions where the first outbreaks occurred, the W.H.O. introduced
            guidelines to stop this practice and reduce stigma directed towards those regions or
            their people.</p>
            <p>Was all the effort for nothing? </p>
            <p>Looking at where America stands right now Patrick
            Corrigan, Professor of Psychology at Illinois Institute of Technology, wrote in one of
            his blogs “Calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus...does nothing to help understand the
            threat, instead fanning the flames of ethnic bigotry that already exists across some
            groups.”</p>
            <p>The ongoing pandemic has brought to the surface many pre-existing
            prejudices which are unravelling the American societal fabric, just as W.H.O.’s 2015
            guidelines forecasted</p>
            <h5>Asian American Communities Pay The Price Of America’s Failure</h5>
            <p>The virus was never under control in the United States.</p>
            <p>No regulation was approved, if one doesn’t consider the numerous “stay at home advisories”
            from local entities.</p>
            <p>America’s leaders firstly ignored that the virus was actually dangerous and then
            proceeded to put the blame for the catastrophe on China.</p>
            <p>This happened quite fast, but the USA are still coping with the fact that they have
            failed in the battle against the virus because they were never eager to take advice or
            look at what other countries were doing. </p>
            <p>Now coronavirus has put America in critical conditions. Not only because of the
            heartbreaking number of losses, but also because of the social earthquake the virus
            provoked.</p>
            <p>Joyce Gu, a Chinese-American student attending Illinois Institute of Technology, told
            me about how the stigma against her birth country changed her life.</p>
            <p>She is now uncomfortable being surrounded by people, and has come to internalize the
            shame and guilt this stigma has placed on East-Asian people.</p>
            <p>“I feel like everyone will just be better if I am not out there.” Joyce said.  She
            recalled seeing crowds at the grocery store, the CTA station, the Subway and thinking
            “Today I’ll do something else.”</p>
            <p>Not only did Covid limit her ability to do things, but Joyce also said “I have always
            been very proud of my descendants, but ever since Covid hit I am no longer in a position
            where I am allowed to be proud. I am more conscious about when and if I have to tell
            people about my origins.”</p>
            <p>This pandemic and the stigma which resulted from it, have played a major role in
            enforcing the already existing disparities in healthcare and justice amongst people of
            different ethnicities living in the USA.</p>
            <p>“The Romans didn't know about the New World,” said John Bauschatz, Professor of
            History and Classics at The University Of Arizona. “There were no rivals to Rome's power
            in Rome's ‘world’...and the empire wasn't brought low by a competing empire. Today, of
            course, there are lots of competing empires.”</p>
            <p>Rome didn’t have any rivals and didn’t know about the World. America has a lot of
            internal and external conflicts to solve but also a deep knowledge of the modern World’s
            functioning. The USA have no excuse for not making it right with China.</p>

        <h3>Academic Essays</h3>
          <section class="essay">
            <h4 class="odd-text">Friendship And Social Media</h4>
              <p>To address the issue concerning the formation of close friendships in mediated
              contexts, such as the Internet, Adam Briggle examines the positive effects of writing
              in his paper “Real friends: how the Internet can foster friendship”.</p>
              <p>Firstly, in response to other authors’ claims that it is impossible to form
              friendships online, Briggle states that it cannot be considered impossible to have a
              genuine friendship in a purely online, written format, since a lot of people have
              experiences of having formed such relationships in wholly mediated contexts.</p>
              <p>Briggle goes on to explain how the deliberateness implied in the writing process
              and the physical distance provided by mediated contexts ensure that individuals are
              honest and more precise when telling about themselves. These factors allow friendships
              to be taken to deeper levels. </p>
              <p>Briggle proceeds to prove these points by telling the story of a soldier and a
              teacher who had never met, yet succeeded in forming a close friendship by exchanging
              written letters.</p>
              <p>Afterwards, Briggle points out the constraints of offline relationships. The author
              states that in real life there are compromises people have to accept because of the
              existing social norms in the different environments they live in; these very
              constraints make offline friendships dishonest and more shallow than online
              friendships. This claim is supported by the example of an accountant, who doesn’t seem
              to have any space in his real-world life to be completely honest about himself with
              his acquaintances.</p>
              <p>Lastly, Briggle quotes different philosophers, among which Nietzsche, Foucault, St.
              Athanasius, Aristoteles, Rousseau, Emerson, and ancient Latin literature works
              —Letters between Seneca and Lucilio— stressing the importance of reading and writing
              in improving self-awareness and creating distance in time and space between
              individuals. Reading and writing are slower acts than speaking, and their slower pace
              promotes deliberateness, moving contrary to the constant speeding up of the
              contemporary world —which according to Briggle prevents from forming deep
              relationships, promoting individuality. Therefore, the author concludes that the
              Internet and other mediated contexts promote friendships stronger than those formed in
              real-life, thanks to the distance and deliberateness implied in written
              communication.</p>
              <p>Briggle wrote this article in 2008, and since then technology has advanced to the
              point that one might not find the two main claims of his essay valid. The distance,
              one of the two major positive aspects of online relationships according to Briggle,
              has been greatly reduced thanks to the possibility to share video, audio and images
              very easily, in a multitude of ways. Thinking of the most used social media in 2020,
              one can choose to video call a friend on the other side of the world via FaceTime,
              Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and get by their side in a moment, see their face,
              their surroundings, listen to their voice, therefore annulling any sort of distance as
              intended by Briggle.</p>
              <p>Speaking of the easiness of sending pictures nowadays, it is possible to think of an
              almost uncountable number of choices a user has, in the event of wanting to send a
              picture to someone else. I made a list of the most popular ones and their different
              features:</p>
              <p>A person can send a picture on Snapchat where it can be:
                <ul>
                   <li>only be viewed for some seconds</li>
                   <li>disappear forever, leaving no trace of having ever been
                    sent to someone.</li>
                  <li>The sender will also be notified if the other person tries o screenshot the
                    picture.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Send the same picture on Instagram, where it can be:
                <ul>
                  <li>viewed once, a couple times or infinite times</li>
                  <li>deleted at any time without leaving any trace of having been sent or deleted.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Send the very same picture on WhatsApp, where it can be:
                <ul>
                  <li>viewed unlimited times by who received it</li>
                  <li>saved without the sender knowing</li>
                  <li>forwarded to other users by the recipient</li>
                  <li>deleted, but leaving a trace of having deleted something on a specific chat</li>
                  <li>It will also leave a permanent trace of having been sent.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>It is clear that online communication hardly stops to writing at this time. In fact
              the very act of writing is something many social media platforms are limiting or
              getting rid of.  Users write fast, use abbreviations, emojis, and prefer sending
              pictures or audio to explain themselves; this feature has been embraced by platforms
              like Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook which turned it into their strength.</p>
              <p>Particularly, Instagram is made of pictures ONLY, with short written captions and
              tons of “hashtags”, brief words preceded by an “#” to improve the traceability of
              one’s posts. This traceability goal has slowly become the very point of using this
              platform: at this point, one could claim there’s hardly a couple people who use
              Instagram to purely tell about themselves. An increasing number of users is extremely
              focused on promoting their work, or even make money thanks to other users’ likes and
              comments.</p>
              <p>It seems to me that this way of communicating also goes way far from that principle
              of deliberateness praised by Briggle. Deliberateness depends on the individuals’
              attentiveness to and precision about one’s own and one’s friends' character, but
              modern social media seem to promote quite the opposite: fast, mostly visual and
              impulsive communication is the basis of how people get to know each other through
              modern media.</p>
              <p>Briggle’s unspoken assumptions that 1—complete honesty is necessary for a deep
              friendship to develop, and 2—the fast pace of the modern World prevents from forming
              deep friendships, are most definitely ignored by the current online environment.</p>
              <p>The pace of the modern online world is even faster than that of offline contexts,
              and social media are becoming more constrained, pushing people to assume a certain
              online identity depending on which platform they are using —a clear example might be
              the common belief among a vast part of the youth in European countries that “Facebook”
              is what you share with relatives and your parents are likely to see, “Instagram” is
              where you show off at your best and maybe get some brand ambassador partnership to
              make money, and “Snapchat” is where you can be silly with your close friends. This
              sole distinction undermines every shot at deliberateness and complete honesty: in
              fact, it seems these social media have reinstalled those very constraints of the
              offline world that Briggle condemned.</p>
              <p>I believe Tumblr is one of the few modern platforms that could be compatible with
              Briggle’s criteria. This social medium allows users to share pictures, written posts,
              video, audio, songs, links, and almost whatever kind of digital content one can think
              of.The only major and significant difference with most modern media is that in the
              event that two users want to communicate directly with each other, they only have one
              way to do that on Tumblr: written chat. Tumblr is a very smart platform, as it doesn’t
              give users the chance to see when the recipient gets or opens a message, and it
              greatly limits the possibility to send pictures via chat —it is possible, but the
              quality and the speed of the platform when sending a picture is a huge deterrent of
              such practice.</p>
              <p>I have noticed that Tumblr users tend to either connect very deeply with each other
              over long spans of time, or exchange a couple fast messages and then lose touch.
              People on Tumblr are aware of this, and they are usually not willing to move out of
              the platform to talk to other users; this, I believe, depends on the fact that most
              people consider Tumblr a safe space where they can be themselves more openly than
              anywhere else.</p>
              <p>Briggle’s “distance in time and space” and “deliberateness of written
              communication” criteria apply in this context, and they seem to foster deeper
              friendships than those in the offline world and other “more technologically advanced”
              social media.</p>

              <li>I was in charge of the graphic design for this project. I designed the logo,
              came up with the name for the escape room, and conducted A/B testing designing two different
              versions of the flyers to promote the opening of the room to the general public.</li>

              <li>I chose to analyze Adobe's business structure, conducting an analysis of its strenghts

                print and web. The newsletter was distributed to the university community and I
                advertised it on the organization's social media platform. The newsletter has a

            <li>I designed all the posts present on the account since May 2021. I used Canva for most
            of my work. I created a brand palette and made sure logos and aesthetics were consistent
            over time. I also created and managed a schedule for advertising the organization's events
            with multiple posts</li>
            <li>When I started managing it, WiSTEM's Instagram account grew by 14.000% from May to
              August 2021. This wasn't the result of any paid advertising effort.</li>
