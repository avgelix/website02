    <h4>Covid-19 upends job search for the class of 2021</h4>
    <section class="newspaper-article">
    <p>The oldest of Gen-Z were to enter the gates of the best job market in 50 years.</p>

    <p>The Class of 2020 was made up of the disillusioned, lazy and entitled kids. Still
    they worked hard. They built visions and projects to change the World, only to be
    remembered as the Class of COVID-19. Now it’s time for the Class of 2021. Will their
    fate match their predecessors’ or will the job market take it easy on them?</p>

    <h5>The foundations</h5>

    <p>Graduating in the country with the best economy in the World. This was the luck of
    students all over the United States graduating in 2020.</p>

    <p>This was the luck of Keara Rigg, a 22-year-old girl who graduated from Illinois
    Institute of Technology in May 2020. Keara got a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. She
    planned to take a MCTA test and shadow a doctor at a local hospital for the summer
    following her graduation.</p>

    <p>This was the luck of Ahmer Rizwan, a 23-year-old Mechanical Engineering major at
    Illinois Institute of Technology. He graduated in May 2020. "I wanted to get a job and
    not go to grad school straight away,” says Ahmer “I had an internship in spring, from
    January to May 2020. The company was going to hire me.” The future looked bright for
    these students with a high quality education and experience in their fields of choice.
    But then a pandemic happened.</p>

    <h5>Crushed expectations</h5>

    <p>When the pandemic hit the country, the unemployment rate rose higher in three
    COVID-19 months than it did in two years of Great Recession. It reached an all-time high
    of 14.7 percent in April 2020, affecting young people the most. These two points seem to
    draw the two recessions close.</p>

    <p>However “The two recessions are very different.” stated in an email Giorgio
    Primiceri, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University in Chicago “The Great
    Recession was large, but overall relatively ‘conventional’...Covid, instead, caused a
    much more abrupt halt in economic activity. This recession has been much more
    violent...although the recovery has also been faster, at least so far.”</p>

    <p>Young people were among the most affected by the Covid recession, but the
    unemployment rates were lower among those with higher levels of education. Young
    students with a Bachelor’s degree are in fact the only group without a double digits
    percentage of unemployed, standing at 7.2 percent.</p>

    <p>“My boss told me they had 652 applications for the position,” said Ahmer Rizwan, a
    Mechanical Engineering major at IIT “but in the end I got it because I had a ton of
    experience related to the role.”</p>

    <h5>Getting in shape or sinking in?</h5>

    <p>The Class of 2021 saw it coming. They had more time to prepare.</p>

    <p> Yet the task does not look easier for them. More than 1.3 million students graduated
    from 2 or 4 year colleges in 2020, and the projections for 2021 are that this number
    will increase by almost 20 percent.</p>

    <p>“My plans were to get a job,” said Jack Pio, a Computer Engineering student at IIT
    who will graduate in May. “Last summer I did have an internship, but it was cancelled.
    Now I don’t have a job offer coming out of the summer.”</p>

    <p>However, sinking in is not an option.</p>

    <p>Students like Jack are still looking for a job that pays them justice. They are not
    going to graduate school only to take shelter from the present time.</p>

    <p>Students like Austin Worley, a senior Aerospace Engineering major at IIT, managed to
    get internships over the summer. They are focusing on their exams right now, looking
    forward to graduating in May.</p>

    <p>Getting in shape for the current job market requires time, hard-work and passion, but
    the Class of 2021 got them all.</p>

    <h5>A new era</h5>

    <p>This recession has hit students in different ways.</p>

    <p>“The service-producing sectors are suffering much more than good-producing sectors,”
    says Professor Giorgio Primiceri. “Consumption of goods has declined sharply in the
    first few months, but has recovered equally fast. Consumption of services, instead, is
    still 10% lower relative to February.”</p>

    <p>“The Tech industry has been growing because companies are shifting to the virtual
    more than ever. Medicine and psychology are also important right now,” Tiara De Guzman,
    a counselor at Illinois Institute of Technology’s Career Center, said via email
    “However, creative industries (architecture, design) and non-profit organizations have
    been shutting down.”</p>

    <p>Despite the strength of the Class of 2021, students are aware that the market is
    thornier than ever and they are getting advice from experts.</p>

    <p>“The biggest advice I have for this particular job search is to be adaptable,” said
    De Guzman “Many companies are doing virtual positions for a while and then expecting
    employees to relocate. Some have hiring freezes so it will take them longer to process
    applications. Be open and flexible.”</p>

    <p>The Covid recession could be start of a new era. An uncertain, scary and competitive
    era. Hopefully the oldest of Gen-Z are as stubborn as this society wants us to
    believe.</p>

    <h4 class="odd-text">Hindsight, the only weapon America has against COVID-19</h4>
    <section class="newspaper-article">
    <p>History teaches us that the Western Roman Empire fell. But did it? The act of falling
    tends to have an immediacy of effect that flows from a rapid unfolding of the action: to
    fall. </p>
    <p>I want to suggest that the falling of the Roman Empire did not happen in the snap
    of a finger, but was more of a slow grazing process. In many ways, the Romans themselves
    were responsible for their own demise, and it seems that we are doing the same to our
    present World. </p>
    <p>America has millennia of history behind her. This country can still clean the mess it
    has made by labeling Asian communities as the enemy during this pandemic.  “America is
    what Rome once was to hustling Jews, Greeks and Numidians.” says Victor Davis Hanson,
    author of the hybrid-genre book Mexifornia “The freedom and material dynamism of the
    West are drawing millions to its shores.”  But if America doesn’t act fast people will
    no longer be so attracted to its land, and the country’s leaders’ reluctance to look
    back and learn from others might constitute the beginning of America’s end. </p>
    <h5>Historia Magistra Vitae</h5>
    <p>In his “De Oratore” Cicero was the first of many to refer to History as an essential
    teaching about life with the literal expression Historia magistra vitae.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the distance in time and space between a 2020 World citizen and
    Cicero, his reflection couldn’t be more relatable to the present situation. </p>
    <p>The Western Roman Empire slowly declined from 363 A.D. until 476 A.D.  It all began
    with the first invasion of the Huns, a nomadic people from the central Asian steppes.
    This event sparked a multi-generational migration phenomenon of Germanic tribes into
    Roman territory. </p>
    <p>The Romans and the Germans began mixing up very fast, to the
    extent that the Germans did not consider themselves foreign conquerors, but people who
    deserved stakeholder status in the empire.</p>
    <p>Still a great majority of the Romans
    did not realize this fusion had happened. “Lots of changes were taking place
    simultaneously in the 4th and 5th centuries, and the migration of Germanic peoples was
    only one of them.” said John Bauschatz, Professor of History and Classics at The
    University Of Arizona “It's also worth pointing out that the largest sections of the
    western empire that survived after AD 476 were run by pseudo-’Germanic’ peoples. So it's
    possible to argue...that the Germanic peoples successfully carried the legacy of Rome
    onward for several centuries after the fall.” </p>
    <p>of Rome onward for several
    centuries after the fall.”  The fusion was not enough to make Roman people understand
    they could not extirpate the Germans from their social structure, but instead that the
    new tribes could be a helping hand. Ignoring this caused the Western Roman Empire, the
    cradle of modern civilization, to fall.  What could we learn from this historical nuance
    about our present time?</p>
    <p>In a World as globalized as ours can we let ourselves believe that sidelining any
    group of individuals along with their history, their beliefs and their teachings can
    be of any good?</p>
    <h5>COVID-19: How A Disease Generated Waves Of Hate</h5>
    <p>COVID-19 is spreading hate
    and fear throughout our World.</p>
    <p>For many the fear of the virus has transformed
    into fear of the Other –which in this case happens to be any person of Asians descent.
    This phenomenon, is referred to as Xenophobia.  The word Xenophobia speaks for itself.
    Its etymology comes from the ancient Greek words ξένος, meaning “foreigner” and
    -φοβία, which means "fear". From this mere linguistic analysis one can easily date the
    start of this phenomenon to Classical Antiquity, even if its most concrete developments
    occurred far later in time. </p>
    <p>Millennia have passed, but the public opinion today looks like it could use a History
    refreshing. In Classical Antiquity, epidemics more often brought societies together
    rather than divided them. Much less civilized peoples, without any of our
    hyper-communication technologies. Yet we are struggling to do the same. </p>
    <p>Pandemics reshuffle power, deconstruct social structures, modify human
    behavior. Fearing them is a natural human impulse, but what we are doing today is an
    additional step: we are projecting this fear on other peoples. </p>
    <h5>Virus Narratives</h5>
    <p>Many countries are ousting Asian people, but we are not in the position to allow our
    leaders to make such decisions. </p>
    <p>“This virus China unleashed on the World” </p>
    <p>“I beat this crazy horrible Chinese virus” </p>
    <p>“It’s China’s fault” </p>
    <p>President Donald Trump has not hesitated to make sure his side of the story was
    heard. He arbitrarily chose to refer to Covid-19 as “Chinese virus” anytime he needed to
    mention it. This same narrative has been embraced by many other World leaders, to the
    extent that Wang Jisi, a scholar at Peking University, said “The virus fallout has
    pushed Sino-US relations to their worst level since formal ties were established in the
    1970s.” </p>
    <p>I had the chance to discuss the same matter with Lincoln Mitchell,
    Professor of Political Science at Columbia University N.Y. who told me “On one end we’re
    in competition...on the other end we have deep economic relationships with China. We
    need China and China needs us. It’s a too-big-to-fail bilateral relationship.” </p>
    <p>Furthermore, looking at the current status of international relations between America
    and China, Professor Mitchell was particularly clear on one point, “We have to have a
    relationship with China. A smart president has to figure out that we can’t get along
    with China on everything, but we need to have a balance. We need relationships more than
    ever right now.” </p>
    <p>Despite all of this, the amount of hate that has been spread
    cannot be undone. But is it really China’s fault? </p>
    <p>According to an article
    published on the Journal of Siberian Federal University in 2019, anthropogenic pressure
    and unhealthy lifestyles are the main factors involved in the birth and spread of
    pandemic diseases.</p>
    <h5>W.H.O. Did What?</h5>
    <p>The World Health Organization is an institution that aims at providing mediation
    among nations to ensure the best health environment possible.</p>
    <p>Since the pandemic spread in 2019, never has W.H.O. referred to coronavirus with any
    term related to China or the Chinese population. That is, of course, not just by
    chance.</p>
    <p>In 2015, after understanding how in the past viral diseases were frequently
    associated with the regions where the first outbreaks occurred, the W.H.O. introduced
    guidelines to stop this practice and reduce stigma directed towards those regions or
    their people.</p>
    <p>Was all the effort for nothing? </p>
    <p>Looking at where America stands right now Patrick
    Corrigan, Professor of Psychology at Illinois Institute of Technology, wrote in one of
    his blogs “Calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus...does nothing to help understand the
    threat, instead fanning the flames of ethnic bigotry that already exists across some
    groups.”</p>
    <p>The ongoing pandemic has brought to the surface many pre-existing
    prejudices which are unravelling the American societal fabric, just as W.H.O.’s 2015
    guidelines forecasted</p>
    <h5>Asian American Communities Pay The Price Of America’s Failure</h5>
    <p>The virus was never under control in the United States.</p>
    <p>No regulation was approved, if one doesn’t consider the numerous “stay at home advisories”
    from local entities.</p>
    <p>America’s leaders firstly ignored that the virus was actually dangerous and then
    proceeded to put the blame for the catastrophe on China.</p>
    <p>This happened quite fast, but the USA are still coping with the fact that they have
    failed in the battle against the virus because they were never eager to take advice or
    look at what other countries were doing. </p>
    <p>Now coronavirus has put America in critical conditions. Not only because of the
    heartbreaking number of losses, but also because of the social earthquake the virus
    provoked.</p>
    <p>Joyce Gu, a Chinese-American student attending Illinois Institute of Technology, told
    me about how the stigma against her birth country changed her life.</p>
    <p>She is now uncomfortable being surrounded by people, and has come to internalize the
    shame and guilt this stigma has placed on East-Asian people.</p>
    <p>“I feel like everyone will just be better if I am not out there.” Joyce said.  She
    recalled seeing crowds at the grocery store, the CTA station, the Subway and thinking
    “Today I’ll do something else.”</p>
    <p>Not only did Covid limit her ability to do things, but Joyce also said “I have always
    been very proud of my descendants, but ever since Covid hit I am no longer in a position
    where I am allowed to be proud. I am more conscious about when and if I have to tell
    people about my origins.”</p>
    <p>This pandemic and the stigma which resulted from it, have played a major role in
    enforcing the already existing disparities in healthcare and justice amongst people of
    different ethnicities living in the USA.</p>
    <p>“The Romans didn't know about the New World,” said John Bauschatz, Professor of
    History and Classics at The University Of Arizona. “There were no rivals to Rome's power
    in Rome's ‘world’...and the empire wasn't brought low by a competing empire. Today, of
    course, there are lots of competing empires.”</p>
    <p>Rome didn’t have any rivals and didn’t know about the World. America has a lot of
    internal and external conflicts to solve but also a deep knowledge of the modern World’s
    functioning. The USA have no excuse for not making it right with China.</p>
